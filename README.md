Beyond my studies, leveraging my background in marketing and advertising, I organized a cultural event in the UK, leading a team of 8 to create and promote online content. The event was covered by at least four media outlets and received over two million views. Additionally, as a content creator, my most popular post on a niche platform garnered nearly 3 million views and 180,000 likes.
